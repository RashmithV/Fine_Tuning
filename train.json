    "question": "Passage: In a world of 7.3 billion people, 2.4 billion lack access to adequate sanitation, of which 1 billion have no choice but to defecate in the open. Most people without adequate sanitation live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Millions lack menstrual hygiene and vital hand washing facilities. Diarrhoeal disease, largely caused by poor water, sanitation and hygiene, is a leading cause of malnutrition, stunting and preventable child mortality, claiming nearly 600,000 lives of children under five annually. Inadequate facilities also affect education and economic productivity and impact the dignity and personal safety of women and girls. With so many solutions at hand, the continuing deprivation of so many is a shameful reflection of our society's priorities. In 1840, the \"global sanitary revolution\" transformed life in Europe and other parts of the developed world. In fact, it actually furthered the economic transformation, by making those societies cleaner and healthier. But many countries still await a sanitation revolution. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, says building toilets is a priority over temples. His finance minister, Arun Jaitley, used a month's budget to set a goal of ending defecating in the open by 2019. That will be 150 years since the birth of Mohandas Gandhi, who said good sanitation was more important than independence. Ending open defecation would bring immense benefits. Some 130 million households lack toilets. More than 72% of rural people relieve themselves behind bushes, in fields or by roadsides. The share is barely shrinking. Of the 1 billion people in the world who have no toilet, India accounts for nearly 600 million. The costs are high. Public safety is one underappreciated problem, as young women have to leave their rural homes after dark. A broader matter is public health. Open defecation is disastrous when practised by groups in close contact with each other. Because India's population is huge, growing rapidly and densely settled, it is impossible even in rural areas to keep human faeces from crops, wells, food and children's hands. They cause enteropathy, a chronic illness that prevents the body from absorbing calories and nutrients. That helps to explain why, in spite of rising incomes and better diets, rates of child malnourishment in India do not improve faster. UNICEF, the UN's agency for children, estimates that nearly one-half of Indian children remain malnourished. Hundreds of thousands of them die from preventable conditions each year, especially in the north, which has the maximum open defecation. Faeces in groundwater spread diseases such as encephalitis, an annual post-monsoon scourge in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Diarrhoea leaves Indians' bodies smaller on average than those of people in poorer countries where people eat fewer calories, notably in Africa. Underweight mothers produce stunted babies prone to sickness who may fail to develop to their full cognitive potential. Fortunately, in developing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the 2016-2030 period, UN Member States have recognized that good sanitation and hygiene (goal 6.2) have positive, knock-on effects for eight other goals. Specifically, these are goals to end poverty and hunger, create healthy lives, provide quality education, attain gender equality, foster sustainable growth, reduce inequality and develop sustainable cities. Sanitation transforms lives. One billion people still defecate in the open, without access to even basic toilets or hand washing facilities. Improved sanitation, hygiene and safe water save millions of lives, accelerate economic growth, enhance people's dignity, and create a better future for all\nIn which of the following areas are women NOT affected by lack of sanitation according to the passage?",
    "answer": "Marriage"

    "question": "Passage: With the United States recently lifting its ban on online betting, the digital gambling landscape has experienced a significant paradigm shift, redefining the intersection between technology and wagering. Once constrained by stringent regulations, platforms facilitating poker, online casinos, and sports betting are now flourishing, attracting an influx of new particularly among the youth. This legislative reversal has catalyzed a global ripple effect, influencing betting dynamics in Europe and beyond. In response to this shift, several companies are launching innovative gambling platforms to capitalize on the growing demand. Unlike traditional casinos, which rely on physical establishments, online betting platforms leverage advanced digital algorithms, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to ensure seamless transactions and enhanced security. The immediacy of placing wagers from mobile applications, coupled with the gamification of betting interfaces, has rendered the experience far more engaging than conventional casino gambling. Furthermore, the integration of live-streaming services within sports betting platforms has heightened real-time interaction, thereby allowing users to engage with the experience in ways never seen before. One of the most pronounced impacts of this digital transition is the surge in sports engagement. With online betting becoming more accessible, the younger demographic is demonstrating a heightened interest in various athletic competitions, including football, and eSports. Europe, a longstanding hub for both regulated gambling and sports culture, has particularly benefited from this trend. Increased viewership and participation in sporting events, coupled with a surge in revenue streams for clubs and leagues, have fortified the economic structure of professional athletics. Moreover, the adoption of responsible gambling initiatives across European jurisdictions has helped mitigate some of the potential downsides of digital wagering. However, despite these apparent advantages, the rapid expansion of online betting carries inherent risks. The accessibility and anonymity afforded by digital gambling platforms can foster addictive behaviors, particularly among impressionable youth. A lack of financial literacy among new bettors exacerbates the potential for substantial monetary losses, while the gamified nature of online casinos may obscure the psychological toll of compulsive gambling. If left unchecked, what was once a recreational activity can quickly devolve into a destructive vice, draining financial resources and leading to social isolation. Additionally, concerns surrounding data privacy, fraudulent schemes, and unregulated markets persist, raising ethical questions about the long-term sustainability of online betting. As the online gambling industry continues to evolve, striking a balance between economic benefits and responsible gaming policies will be paramount. Without adequards, the societal costs of unchecked digital betting could outweigh its economic and recreational merits.\n\nQuestion: Identify the INCORRECT statement based on the passage.",

This technology has become increasingly prominent with the _____ of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Offering hands-free interactions, voice recognition systems enable users to make requests, set reminders, and perform various tasks simply by speaking. The process involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs that can identify and differentiate voices. Some ASR programs necessitate users to train the system for improved accuracy in converting speech to text. Evaluation of a voice's frequency, accent, and speech flow is integral to voice recognition systems. While voice recognition and speech recognition are often used interchangeably they have distinct meanings. Voice recognition identifies the speaker, whereas speech recognition assesses the content of what is said. In practice, voice recognition software on computers converts analog audio into digital signals through analog- to-digital (A/D) conversion. This digital database of words or syllables is then compared to signals during pattern recognition. The size of the program's effective vocabulary depends on the computer's RAM capacity, with faster processing speeds enhancing search capabilities. Voice recognition involves analyzing speech through models like the hidden Markov model or recurrent neural networks. The former breaks down spoken words into phonemes, while the latter uses previous outputs to influence current inputs, improving capabilities and accuracy with increased data. The integration of voice recognition into smartphones and home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo has made this technology ubiquitous. As more users engage with voice recognition, the wealth of data generated enhances the capabilities and accuracy of these systems, indicating a promising trajectory for the technology's future.\n\nQuestion: Choose the most suitable word that should fill the given blank.",

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless. And, there is no state backing.\n\nQuestion: Why Central Bank Digital Currency cannot solve the RBI's problem?",
    "answer": "Because CBDC is a fiat currency and cannot be used for transactions as cryptocurrency."

    "question": "Passage: Voice or speaker recognition refers to a machine or program's ability to interpret dictation or understand and execute spoken commands. This technology has become increasingly prominent with the _____ of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Offering hands-free interactions, voice recognition systems enable users to make requests, set reminders, and perform various tasks simply by speaking. The process involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs that can identify and differentiate voices. Some ASR programs necessitate users to train the system for improved accuracy in converting speech to text. Evaluation of a voice's frequency accent, and speech flow is integral to voice recognition systems. While voice recognition and speech recognition are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings. Voice recognition identifies the speaker, whereas speech recognition assesses the content of what is said. In practice, voice recognition software on computers converts analog audio into digital signals through analog- to-digital (A/D) conversion. This digital database of words or syllables is then compared to signals during pattern recognition. The size of the program's effective vocabulary depends on the computer's RAM capacity, with faster processing speeds enhancing search capabilities. Voice recognition involves analyzing speech through models like the hidden Markov model or recurrent neural networks. The former breaks down spoken words into phonemes, while the latter uses previous outputs to influence current inputs, improving capabilities and accuracy with increased data. The integration of voice recognition into smartphones and home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo has made this technology ubiquitous. As more users engage with voice recognition, the wealth of data generated enhances the capabilities and accuracy of these systems, indicating a promising trajectory for the technology's future.

Plantations, vast tracts of land dedicated to single crops like tea, rubber, or coffee, must navigate various challenges through innovative strategies.

This is achieved through organic practices and nutrient replenishment, preventing the degradation associated with intensive agriculture. Efficient water management is also crucial, especially in regions facing water scarcity. Techniques like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting ensure optimal water use while _____________resources. Additionally, modern plantations employ advanced technology to monitor plant health and manage irrigation systems, allowing for swift, informed decision-making.

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless. And, there is no state backing.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following words is a synonym of \u2018worthless\u2019 given in the passage?",

    "question": "Passage: United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen's proposal for global coordination of corporate taxation has huge implications. She has proposed a global minimum tax rate. If the major world economies agree and the U.S. Congress approves the increased tax rates, it would constitute a reversal of the trend in tax policies since the Soviet Bloc 30 years back. Would Ms. Yellen succeed in convincing OECD countries and the U.S. Congress? David R. Malpass, President of the World Bank, representing the interest of global capital, has voiced his opposition. He was shooting from the shoulders of the poor countries when he said the proposal \"...would hinder poor countries' ability to attract investment\". The initiative which has been long overdue is being forced on the rich countries by the impact of the pandemic. Presently, governments need resources to help people through the transfer of incomes, provision of more public services and also prevent business failures. But their resources have been dismally affected by the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic era, such levels of the deficit would have led to the tanking of the stock markets but now they are booming in anticipation of demand being pumped in by these high deficits. The result is a massive increase in inequality between those who have gained in the stock markets and those who have lost employment and incomes. Additional tax collections can help reduce these large fiscal deficits and that is the reason for the U.S. administration's current proposal. But businesses and conservative legislators will resist. However, some rich Americans like Jeff Bezos have supported the idea of taxing the rich more. Such proposals have been around since 2011 when many of the rich in the U.S. and Europe had supported higher taxation on the rich. Subsequently, this proposal has come up several times. When the Soviet Bloc collapsed in 1990, nations in eastern Europe were badly hit and needed capital infusion to overcome their economic woes. To attract global capital, they cut their tax rates sharply. This resulted in a 'race to the bottom'. Nations in Europe were forced to cut their tax rates one after to not only attract capital but also to prevent capital from leaving their shores. This had global implications. Nations became short of resources and cut back expenditures on public services and encouraged privatization. Governments lacked resources for education, health and civic amenities.\n\nWhat is/are the major roadblock(s) to reducing the large fiscal deficit?",
    "answer": "Resistance by conservative legislators poses an impediment."

Flexible work is still regarded as an add-on, something we do for mothers for a few months when they are back from parental leave.\n\nIn today's workforce, fewer people identify with the stereotype of the ideal worker - a full-time, fully committed employee without personal or family commitments that impact on availability.\n\nSimilarly, technology is driving - and enabling - greater flexibility. It is dramatically reshaping our workplaces, blurring the boundaries between work and home and diversifying where, when and how employees work.\n\nFor example, a UK bakery sat down with their bakers and came up with a flexible system of two to three baking shifts a day to maintain a steady supply of fresh bread. The team agreed to rotate their hours each week so no team member permanently worked a shift that did not suit. After the change was made, bakery sales increased by more than 65% in the first year and employee satisfaction in the bakery has risen 10% since the change to 93%.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is the most appropriate title for the passage?",

    "question": "Passage: Voice or speaker recognition refers to a machine or program's ability to interpret dictation or understand and execute spoken commands. This technology has become increasingly prominent with the ______ of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Offering hands-free interactions, voice recognition systems enable users to make requests, set reminders, and perform various tasks simply by speaking. The process involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs that can identify and differentiate voices. Some ASR programs necessitate users to train the system for improved accuracy in converting speech to text. Evaluation of a voice's frequency accent, and speech flow is integral to voice recognition systems. While voice recognition and speech recognition are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings. Voice recognition identifies the speaker, whereas speech recognition assesses the content of what is said. In practice, voice recognition software on computers analog audio into digital signals through analog- to-digital (A/D) conversion. This digital database of words or syllables is then compared to signals during pattern recognition. The size of the program's effective vocabulary depends on the computer's RAM capacity, with faster processing speeds enhancing search capabilities. Voice recognition involves analyzing speech through models like the hidden Markov model or recurrent neural networks. The former breaks down spoken words into phonemes, while the latter uses previous outputs to influence current inputs, improving capabilities and accuracy with increased data. The integration of voice recognition into smartphones and home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo has made this technology ubiquitous. As more users engage with voice recognition, the wealth of data generated enhances the capabilities and accuracy of these systems, indicating a promising trajectory for the technology's future.\n\nQuestion: What is the specific focus of voice recognition in comparison to speech recognition?",
    "answer": "Voice recognition predominantly centers on discerning the speaker's identity rather than appraising the uttered content."

    "question": "Passage: On the day the rupee breached the 74-mark against the US dollar for the first time, RBI governor Urjit Patel on Friday reiterated that the domestic currency is still better than its emerging market peers and that the apex bank does not have a target for it. After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its fourth bi-monthly policy, this fiscal left the policy rates unchanged and ruled out a rate cut in the rest of the fiscal, the rupee plummeted to 74.13 against the dollar, after opening higher than its previous close at 73.52. Admitting that the country has not been immune to global spillovers from external factors, Patel said, \"The rupee fall, in some respect, is moderate in comparison to several other emerging market peers.\" Ruling out a target for the currency, he said, \"Our response to these unsettled conditions has been to ensure that the foreign exchange market remains liquid with no undue volatility. There is no target or band around any particular level of exchange rate, which is determined by market forces demand and supply.\" Addressing the media after the customary post-policy presser, Mr Patel said the rupee has experienced bouts of volatility since the monetary policy committee meeting in August. By the end of September, the rupee has depreciated in nominal effective terms by 5.6 per cent since the end of March. In real effective term, the rupee fall has been at 5 per cent, the governor said, adding the foreign exchange reserves of $400.5 billion as of end September, are sufficient to finance 10 months of imports.\n\nWhich of the following stands TRUE as per the reading of the given passage?",

If your employer matches part of your contribution - and many do! - you will accumulate yet more. A second way to consistently save is with an automatic savings transfer program with your financial institution. You decide how much and when you want funds transferred from your checking account into a savings account. You can also use a payroll deduction plan from your employer and get the same results.\n\nAlong with how much and how often you save, what you earn on your funds will determine how fast your money grows. You cannot control what happens with interest rates or the stock market, but you can consider different types of savings vehicles that provide different returns. The simplest savings vehicle to consider is buying certificates of deposit (CDs) instead of leaving funds in a savings account. CDs usually offer higher interest rates, but they are time deposits and have ....................... for early withdrawal.

The SHG scheme has proven to be very successful for women empowerment and offering to break slowly away from exploitation and isolation. NABARD defines SHGs as \u201csmall, economically homogenous affinity groups of rural poor, voluntarily formed to save and mutually contribute to a common fund to be lent to its members as per the group members' decision\". A self-help group is a village-based financial intermediary composed of 10-20 local women. Members make small regular savings aid over a few months until there is enough capital in the group to begin lending. Funds may then be lent back to the members or to others in the village for any reason. The Self Help Groups (SHGs) have become extensive, successful component of both rural and urban development in India. Women band together in to groups and motivate each other to build new opportunities for income generation. Most of the SHGs start without any outside financial capital by saving regular charity by the members. These offerings can be very small. After a period of regular savings the SHGs start to give loans from savings in the form of small in-house loans for micro enterprise activities and spending. Only those SHGs that have utilized their own funds well are assisted with external funds through linkages with banks and other financial mediators.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following word is an antonym of 'composed' given in the passage?",

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless. And, there is no state backing.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following words is an antonym of \u201cderives\u201d given in the passage?",

    "question": "Passage: For years, world-wide organisations have become increasingly excited about the prospect of a cloud-based future. As the dream becomes an ever closer reality for many kinds of business and, Forrester predicted that enterprise spending on cloud services is set to surge. IDC also predicted that global spending on public cloud services and infrastructure would reach $210bn in 2019, an increase of 24% from 2018. But one obstacle stands create friction and introduce risk: the process of migration. As all indications point to a massive shift in data deployments to the cloud, it is more important than ever that the transition from on-premises to Cloud is as risk free as possible. In today's climate any loss or disruption to data can have a huge business impact. It's a complex process, is frequently underestimated and many organisations have found there's lots that can go wrong that can impact the business. Organisations across the globe have found to be an ideal place to run modern data applications due to big data's elastic resource requirements. Furthermore, with the lack of data talent an ever-looming issue for most companies today they have been determined to adopt a cloud-first strategy to ensure business operations are accessible for a range of employees. The cloud offers great promise for developers especially, as it can increase the speed at which they develop software features and increase the resilience of applications once they are deployed - along with enhanced security through the use of multiple server locations. With all this considered, it is no surprise that 42% of UK businesses leverage some kind of cloud service, according to Eurostat. However, all the perceived benefits of leveraging the cloud are redundant if organisations come up against barriers to accessing cloud services. Cloud-based data pipelines still suffer from complexity challenges at the moment, along with the lack of visibility into cost and resource usage at the application and user level. The answer to this is automation fueled by robust Machine learning training models and artificial intelligence. These concepts and the tools that enable them can determine the prerequisites of cloud infrastructure, application dependencies,the appropriate target cloud instance profiles, and provide troubleshooting in real-time. To summarise, the promise of the cloud has created a sense of excitement amongst enterprises, however, they have proceeded to go full steam ahead into adopting a cloud service, without sufficient data to ensure performance service level agreements (SLAs).\n\nQuestion: Which of the following words is most similar to the word \"ENSURE\" as given in the passage?",

    "question": "Passage: Most people spend (on average) half of their day tapping away at their hand-held devices. Either, surfing the net or checking notifications. Facebook ranks the highest in all social networking platforms, followed by Twitter, Instagram and so forth. Social media is addictive- which is why so many people are 'hooked'. Often referred to as Social networking addiction, this phrase is often used to describe someone who spends too much time on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other channels. A blog post, Instagram post, tweet, or youtube video can be produced easily by anyone and shared, which can then be viewed by millions for free. Psychologists and scientists have now taken the time to study social media in terms of why they believe it interferes with aspects of our daily life. There is no official medical term that identifies addiction and social networking. It cannot be deemed as a disease or disorder as the cases are not severe and the habit can easily be maintained or prevented. Furthermore, instead of spending long periods of time on social media, we dip into and out of these sites all day long. We check for updates from friends and family as well as news and information. However, the behavior associated with the excessive use of these channels has become the subject of much public and sociological debate. We actively post, like, comment and share personal posts. Not only that, we tend to share and reshare expressions (of either negative or positive) contagiously. But, why? Scientists believed some years ago that, dopamine was simply a pleasure chemical in the brain. Recent studies have shown that; dopamine actually produces the desire in people to 'want' by drawing out the need for us to - seek and search. Creating the ultimate drive to find what is that what we want. Dopamine is spontaneous. It's stimulated by unpredictability and small bits of information as well as reward cues which are the same conditions that social media presents to all users. In addition, the pull of dopamine is so strong that recent studies have shown that tweeting, for example, can be harder to resist than cigarettes and alcohol! Researchers at Chicago University studied the effects of social media. They concluded quite quickly that people presented higher levels of addiction to social media than the need to smoke or drink. Media cravings ranked higher. And, let's not forget oxytocin, many call it the cuddle chemical because the brain releases pleasure chemicals that transpire usually when you kiss and hug- or tweet. It is also known as the hormone that builds the strong yet unique bond between mothers and their babies. Oxytocin is now regarded as the human stimulant of empathy, generosity, trust, and more. These are factors which many advertisers play on when promoting a brand or business over social media. Nevertheless, problems have arisen most commonly with school kids - whereby mobile phone devices have been confiscated because exam results have fallen severely due to lack of attention on homework or studies. Schools in many westernized countries have had to take drastic action - banning smartphones, iPad and most portable devices from school premises- as it is claimed to be a huge distraction. Whereas, other schools use it for educational purposes and as a rewards system for their pupils. Research has also indicated unsurprisingly that Facebook is the most common activity that university students switch to, when studying. Worryingly, it has also found that those who most engage in this type of internet browsing tend to have lower levels of educational achievement. Also, there have been many cases of students posting or sharing content that is unethical, which has caused parents and academic institutions to limit the use of these online networking channels.\n\nQuestion: What were the conclusions taken out by the researchers at Chicago University on studying the effects of social media?",

    "question": "Passage: Amy Carter, a marketing professor at New York University, has always been fascinated by how people manage time. Her interest deepened when she observed the stark differences between her two sons. Despite growing up in the same environment, they follow completely different approaches to time management. One son follows Eventual Time (ET), while the other relies on Scheduling Time (ST). Daniel, her older son, follows ET, believing that tasks should be completed when the right moment arrives. He enjoys flexibility and trusts that everything will get done eventually. He dislikes strict schedules, as he feels they limit creativity and add unnecessary pressure. On the other hand, Ben, her younger son, follows ST. He believes that structuring his day with a fixed schedule ensures efficiency and prevents delays. He plans his work carefully, ensuring that each task is completed within a set deadline. Both approaches have their benefits and challenges. ET allows for creative freedom and reduces stress, but it can lead to procrastination. Some tasks may be left unfinished for too long, causing last-minute rushes. ST, however, promotes discipline and productivity but can become exhausting. Ben often feels drawn into a rigid routine, leaving little room for unexpected changes. At times, his packed schedule makes it difficult to relax. Amy, being a researcher, decided to explore these differences further. She conducted several studies and published papers on time management, analyzing which method works best in different scenarios. She found that neither ET is universally superior. Instead, the effectiveness of each approach depends on personality, work demands, and lifestyle. Some individuals thirst for structure, while others thrive in flexibility. Through her research, Amy suggests that blending both methods might be the ideal approach. A balance between structure and adaptability can help individuals manage their time more effectively. By understanding their own preferences, people can optimize their routines while maintaining creativity and reducing stress. Amy continues to explore these ideas, hoping to offer valuable insights into how people interact with time.\n\nWhich of the following is a potential downside of Eventual Time (ET)?",

A growing number of poor women in different areas of India are members of Self Help Groups and they actively occupy in savings and credit, as well as activities like income creation, natural resources management etc. The savings and credit hub in the SHG is the key component and offers ability to create some control over capital and other investments. The SHG scheme has proven to be very successful for women empowerment and offering to break slowly away from exploitation and isolation. NABARD defines SHGs as \u201csmall, economically homogenous affinity groups of rural poor, voluntarily formed to save and mutually contribute to a common fund to be lent to its members as per the group members' decision\". A self-help group is a village-based financial intermediary composed of 10-20 local women. Members make small regular savings aid over a few months until there is enough capital in the group to begin lending. Funds may then be lent back to the members or to others in the village for any reason. The Self Help Groups (SHGs) have become extensive, successful component of both rural and urban development in India. Women band together in to groups and motivate each other to build new opportunities for income generation. Most of the SHGs start without any outside financial capital by saving regular charity by the members. These offerings can be very small. After a period of regular savings the SHGs start to give loans from savings in the form of small in-house loans for micro enterprise activities and spending. Only those SHGs that have utilized their own funds well are assisted with external funds through linkages with banks and other financial mediators.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following word is a synonym of 'isolation' given in the passage?",

Managers need to know their employees well to expect them to contribute their level best and also to remain loyal towards the organization. Employees need to feel valued and important at the workplace for their level best. Knowing employees well leads to a healthy work culture. Managers connect with their team members and to know each other better. No individual can work in an organization where people do not talk to each other. Human beings need people around to talk to and express their feelings. We spend the maximum part of our day at workplaces and it is essential for us to have friends here. Work becomes a mere source of burden when individuals are glued to their computers the whole day. Discussions and brainstorming sessions lead to innovative solutions and quick results. Knowing employees strengthens the relationship between employees and their Bosses. Being rude to employees will not only demotivate them but also make you an unpopular member within the organization. Call them by their names rather than addressing as \u201cMr/Ms\u201d or \u201cHey\u201d, greet them with a smile and enquire what is going on in their personal lives once in a while and see the difference yourself. Trust me; you will be elated to see employees striving hard to accomplish assigned targets within the shortest possible time frame. Conflicts and misunderstandings lead to no solutions. Fights over petty issues not only lead to frustration but also spoil the ambience at the workplace. Do not forget that we are not school going kids who would fight over small things. It is essential to behave as mature professionals. Encourage healthy communication at workplace where employees get an opportunity to interact with each other, discuss ideas and also gain from each other's expertise. Let them open up. Knowing each other well leads to better understanding among employees and they seldom fight with each other, eventually leading to a healthy and positive work culture. It also leads to peace at the workplace. Knowing employees helps managers to understand how he can motivate his team members and use them to the best of their abilities. It helps you to understand which team member would fit into which particular role and which employee would not do justice to his work. Knowing employees helps you judge your subordinates well and hence there is no question of confusions at the workplace.

    "question": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it. Certain words are given in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions.\n\nPassage: Have you heard that the economy is like a car? It's the most popular analogy in financial reporting and political discourse. The American people are repeatedly told by financial pundits and politicians that consumption is an 'engine' that 'drives' economic growth because it makes up 70% of GDP. One notable Nobel-winning economics pundit with a penchant for bizarre growth theories even recently noted that an economy can be 'based on purchases of yachts, luxury cars, and the services of personal trainers and celebrity chefs.' Conversely, other economists including Nobel-winner Joseph Stiglitz claim that our economy is stuck in 'first gear' due to inequality: too much income is concentrated among too few rich people who tend to save larger share of their income and thus have a lower 'marginal propensity to consume'. The Keynesian message is clear: if you want to put the economic pedal to the metal, get out there and consume! Not so fast, Speed Racer. The systematic failure by Keynesian economists and pundits to distinguish between consuming and producing value is the single most damaging fallacy in popular economic thinking. If the economy were a car, consumer preferences would surely be the steering wheel, but real savings and investment would be the engine that drives it forward. Economic growth (booms) and declines (bust) have always been led by changes in business and durable goods investment, while final consumer goods spending has been relatively stable through the business cycle. Booms and busts in financial markets, heavy industry and housing have always been leading indicators of recession and recovery. As John Stuart Mill put it two centuries ago, 'the demand for commodities is not the demand for labor.' Consumer demand does not necessarily translate into increased employment. That's because 'consumers' don't employ people. Businesses do. Since new hires are a risky and costly investment with unknown future returns, employers must rely on their expectations about the future and weigh those decision very carefully. As economic historian Robert Higgs' pioneering work on the Great Depression suggests, increased uncertainty can depress job growth even in the face of booming consumption. As recent years have demonstrated, consumer demand that appears to be driven by temporary or unsustainable policies is unlikely to induce businesses to hire.\nQ24. Which of the following is/are likely to induce businesses to hire?",
    "answer": "Increased certainty in future returns."

    "question": "Read the passage given below and answer the following questions. Information technology has revolutionized the modern world, transforming how individuals and organizations communicate, learn, work, and entertain themselves. From the internet and mobile devices to cloud computing and artificial intelligence, IT has transformed virtually every aspect of human activity. As such, it has created new opportunities and challenges, raising questions about privacy, security, intellectual property, and the digital divide. One of the most significant implications of IT is its impact on the way we communicate and access information. With the advent of the internet and social media, individuals can now connect with others, share their ideas, and access vast amounts of information from anywhere in the world. This has empowered individuals, democratized knowledge, and enabled new forms of collaboration and innovation. However, it has also created new risks, such as the spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, and online harassment. Another key implication of IT is impact on the economy and the nature of work. With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, many jobs are becoming redundant, while new ones are emerging. This has led to a widening skills gap and increased demand for digital skills. Moreover, the growing use of freelancers and remote work has blurred the boundaries of traditional employment, raising questions about labor rights and the gig economy. As such, policymakers and businesses must work together to ensure that IT creates inclusive, equitable, and sustainable economic opportunities for all. With the internet and various software tools, we can now access and amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This has led to improvements in areas such as healthcare, education, and business. For example, doctors can now access patient data remotely and collaborate with specialists from around the world, while businesses can use data analytics to optimize their operations and reach new customers. However, with the benefits come concerns. One of the biggest challenges is data privacy and security. As more and more personal information is stored and shared online, the risk of data breaches and identity theft also increases. In addition, there are concerns about the impact of technology on jobs and the economy. As automation and artificial intelligence become more prevalent, there is a risk of job displacement and a widening income gap between those who possess the necessary skills and those who do not. In addition to its impact on communication and information technology has also transformed the business landscape. From e-commerce to supply chain management, digital technology has revolutionized how companies operate and interact with customers. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning algorithms, businesses can now make data-driven decisions, personalize customer experiences, and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency.\n\nQ73. How has the nature of work been affected by information technology?",
    "answer": "Information technology has had a largely positive impact on the nature of work, as it has enabled greater productivity and the emergence of new jobs."

    "question": "Passage: With the United States recently lifting its ban on online betting, the digital gambling landscape has experienced a significant paradigm shift, redefining the intersection between technology and wagering. Once constrained by stringent regulations, platforms facilitating poker, online casinos, and sports betting are now flourishing, attracting an influx of new particularly among the youth. This legislative reversal has catalyzed a global ripple effect, influencing betting dynamics in Europe and beyond. In response to this shift, several companies are launching innovative gambling platforms to capitalize on the growing demand. Unlike traditional casinos, which rely on physical establishments, online betting platforms leverage advanced digital algorithms, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to ensure seamless transactions and enhanced security. The immediacy of placing wagers from mobile applications, coupled with the gamification of betting interfaces, has rendered the experience far more engaging than conventional casino gambling. Furthermore, the integration of live-streaming services within sports betting platforms has heightened real-time interaction, thereby allowing users to engage with the experience in ways never seen before. One of the most pronounced impacts of this digital transition is the surge in sports engagement. With online betting becoming more accessible, the younger demographic is demonstrating a heightened interest in various athletic competitions, including football, and eSports. Europe, a longstanding hub for both regulated gambling and sports culture, has particularly benefited from this trend. Increased viewership and participation in sporting events, coupled with a surge in revenue streams for clubs and leagues, have fortified the economic structure of professional athletics. Moreover, the adoption of responsible gambling initiatives across European jurisdictions has helped mitigate some of the potential downsides of digital wagering. However, despite these apparent advantages, the rapid expansion of online betting carries inherent risks. The accessibility and anonymity afforded by digital gambling platforms can foster addictive behaviors, particularly among impressionable youth. A lack of financial literacy among new bettors exacerbates the potential for substantial monetary losses, while the gamified nature of online casinos may obscure the psychological toll of compulsive gambling. If left unchecked, what was once a recreational activity can quickly devolve into a destructive vice, draining financial resources and leading to social isolation. Additionally, concerns surrounding data privacy, fraudulent schemes, and unregulated markets persist, raising ethical questions about the long-term sustainability of online betting. As the online gambling industry continues to evolve, striking a balance between economic benefits and responsible gaming policies will be paramount. Without adequards, the societal costs of unchecked digital betting could outweigh its economic and recreational merits.\n\nQuestion: Based on the passage, how has the U.S. decision to legalize online betting impacted global gambling trends?",
    "answer": "The ripple effect of this decision has influenced European markets by increasing sports engagement and enhancing revenue streams for clubs and leagues."

    "question": "Passage: In a world of 7.3 billion people, 2.4 billion lack access to adequate sanitation, of which 1 billion have no choice but to defecate in the open. Most people without adequate sanitation live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Millions lack menstrual hygiene and vital hand washing facilities. Diarrhoeal disease, largely caused by poor water, sanitation and hygiene, is a leading cause of malnutrition, stunting and preventable child mortality, claiming nearly 600,000 lives of children under five annually. Inadequate facilities also affect education and economic productivity and impact the dignity and personal safety of women and girls. With so many solutions at hand, the continuing deprivation of so many is a shameful reflection of our society's priorities. In 1840, the \"global sanitary revolution\" transformed life in Europe and other parts of the developed world. In fact, it actually furthered the economic transformation, by making those societies cleaner and healthier. But many countries still await a sanitation revolution. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, says building toilets is a priority over temples. His finance minister, Arun Jaitley, used a month's budget to set a goal of ending defecating in the open by 2019. That will be 150 years since the birth of Mohandas Gandhi, who said good sanitation was more important than independence. Ending open defecation would bring immense benefits. Some 130 million households lack toilets. More than 72% of rural people relieve themselves behind bushes, in fields or by roadsides. The share is barely shrinking. Of the 1 billion people in the world who have no toilet, India accounts for nearly 600 million. The costs are high. Public safety is one underappreciated problem, as young women have to leave their rural homes after dark. A broader matter is public health. Open defecation is disastrous when practised by groups in close contact with each other. Because India's population is huge, growing rapidly and densely settled, it is impossible even in rural areas to keep human faeces from crops, wells, food and children's hands. They cause enteropathy, a chronic illness that prevents the body from absorbing calories and nutrients. That helps to explain why, in spite of rising incomes and better diets, rates of child malnourishment in India do not improve faster. UNICEF, the UN's agency for children, estimates that nearly one-half of Indian children remain malnourished. Hundreds of thousands of them die from preventable conditions each year, especially in the north, which has the maximum open defecation. Faeces in groundwater spread diseases such as encephalitis, an annual post-monsoon scourge in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Diarrhoea leaves Indians' bodies smaller on average than those of people in poorer countries where people eat fewer calories, notably in Africa. Underweight mothers produce stunted babies prone to sickness who may fail to develop to their full cognitive potential. Fortunately, in developing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the 2016-2030 period, UN Member States have recognized that good sanitation and hygiene (goal 6.2) have positive, knock-on effects for eight other goals. Specifically, these are goals to end poverty and hunger, create healthy lives, provide quality education, attain gender equality, foster sustainable growth, reduce inequality and develop sustainable cities. Sanitation transforms lives. One billion people still defecate in the open, without access to even basic toilets or hand washing facilities. Improved sanitation, hygiene and safe water save millions of lives, accelerate economic growth, enhance people's dignity, and create a better future for all.\nWhich among the following is the most suitable synonym for the word 'foster' in the context of the given passage?",

    "question": "Directions: Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow by choosing the correct/most appropriate options: Amidst global turmoil, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the largest international consortium of scientists analyzing and reviewing the evidence on the present and future man-made impacts of climate change - has a message that is predictably dire. The world faces unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades with global warming of 1.5\u2103; even temporarily exceeding this warming level would mean additional severe impacts, some of which will be irreversible. The report points out that the rise in weather and climate extremes has led to some irreversible impacts as natural and human systems are pushed beyond their ability to adapt. Alluding to the Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, in November 2021, the report notes that most of the targets that countries have set for themselves are too far in the future to have an impact in the short term at meaningfully reducing the climate impact. India will achieve net-zero emissions latest by 2070, that is, there will be no net carbon emissions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared at the COP26 summit. By 2030, India would also energy will be from renewable energy sources. However, none of this can help the 1.5\u2103 mark from being breached. A major point of emphasis of the report, particularly for South Asia, is the trend in the \u2018wet bulb\u2019 temperature - an index of the impact of heat and humidity combined - and its effect on health. Lucknow and Patna, according to one of several studies cited in the report, were among the cities predicted to reach wet-bulb temperatures of 35\u2103 if emissions continued to rise, while Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, Mumbai, Indore, and Ahmedabad are \u2018at risk\u2019 of reaching wet-bulb temperatures of 32\u00b0C-34\u00b0C with continued emissions. This will have consequences such as a rise in heat-wave linked deaths or reduced productivity. Global sea levels will likely rise 44cm-76cm this century if governments meet their current emissions-cutting pledges. But with higher emissions, and if ice sheets collapse more quickly than expected, sea levels could rise as much as 2 meters this century and 5m by 2150. India is one of the most vulnerable country in terms of the population that will be affected by sea-level rise. By the middle of the century, around 35 million of its people could face annual coastal flooding, with 45 million at risk by the end of the century if emissions are high. Experience has shown that partisan economic calculations trump climate considerations, but India must shore up its adaptation measures and urgently move to secure the futures of its many vulnerable who have the most to lose. Which of the following is/are correct according to the given passage? A. If ice sheets collapse more quickly than expected, sea levels could rise as much as 2 meters by this century. B. The world faces avoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades with global warming of 10.5\u00b0C. C. The rise in weather and climate extremes has led to some reversible impacts.",

    "question": "Passage: Amy Carter, a marketing professor at New York University, has always been fascinated by how people manage time. Her interest deepened when she observed the stark differences between her two sons. Despite growing up in the same environment, they follow completely different approaches to time management. One son follows Eventual Time (ET), while the other relies on Scheduling Time (ST). Daniel, her older son, follows ET, believing that tasks should be completed when the right moment arrives. He enjoys flexibility and trusts that everything will get done eventually. He dislikes strict schedules, as he feels they limit creativity and add unnecessary pressure. On the other hand, Ben, her younger son, follows ST. He believes that structuring his day with a fixed schedule ensures efficiency and prevents delays. He plans his work carefully, ensuring that each task is completed within a set deadline. Both approaches have their benefits and challenges. ET allows for creative freedom and reduces stress, but it can lead to procrastination. Some tasks may be left unfinished for too long, causing last-minute rushes. ST, however, promotes discipline and productivity but can become exhausting. Ben often feels drawn into a rigid routine, leaving little room for unexpected changes. At times, his packed schedule makes it difficult to relax. Amy, being a researcher, decided to explore these differences further. She conducted several studies and published papers on time management, analyzing which method works best in different scenarios. She found that neither ET is universally superior. Instead, the effectiveness of each approach depends on personality, work demands, and lifestyle. Some individuals thirst for structure, while others thrive in flexibility. Through her research, Amy suggests that blending both methods might be the ideal approach. A balance between structure and adaptability can help individuals manage their time more effectively. By understanding their own preferences, people can optimize their routines while maintaining creativity and reducing stress. Amy continues to explore these ideas, hoping to offer valuable insights into how people interact with time.\n\nWhat inspired Amy Carter's interest in time management?",

IDC also predicted that global spending on public cloud services and infrastructure would reach $210bn in 2019, an increase of 24% from 2018. But one obstacle stands create friction and introduce risk: the process of migration. As all indications point to a massive shift in data deployments to the cloud, it is more important than ever that the transition from on-premises to Cloud is as risk free as possible. In today's climate any loss or disruption to data can have a huge business impact. It's a complex process, is frequently underestimated and many organisations have found there's lots that can go wrong that can impact the business. Organisations across the globe have found to be an ideal place to run modern data applications due to big data's elastic resource requirements. Furthermore, with the lack of data talent an ever-looming issue for most companies today they have been determined to adopt a cloud-first strategy to ensure business operations are accessible for a range of employees. The cloud offers great promise for developers especially, as it can increase the speed at which they develop software features and increase the resilience of applications once they are deployed - along with enhanced security through the use of multiple server locations. With all this considered, it is no surprise that 42% of UK businesses leverage some kind of cloud service, according to Eurostat. However, all the perceived benefits of leveraging the cloud are redundant if organisations come up against barriers to accessing cloud services. Cloud-based data pipelines still suffer from complexity challenges at the moment, along with the lack of visibility into cost and resource usage at the application and user level. The answer to this is automation fueled by robust Machine learning training models and artificial intelligence. These concepts and the tools that enable them can determine the prerequisites of cloud infrastructure, application dependencies,the appropriate target cloud instance profiles, and provide troubleshooting in real-time. To summarise, the promise of the cloud has created a sense of excitement amongst enterprises, however, they have proceeded to go full steam ahead into adopting a cloud service, without sufficient data to ensure performance service level agreements (SLAs).\n\nQuestion: Why the promise of the cloud has created a sense of excitement amongst enterprises?",
    "answer": "As it ensures that business operations are accessible for a range of employees."

    "question": "Passage: Amy Carter, a marketing professor at New York University, has always been fascinated by how people manage time. Her interest deepened when she observed the stark differences between her two sons. Despite growing up in the same environment, they follow completely different approaches to time management. One son follows Eventual Time (ET), while the other relies on Scheduling Time (ST). Daniel, her older son, follows ET, believing that tasks should be completed when the right moment arrives. He enjoys flexibility and trusts that everything will get done eventually. He dislikes strict schedules, as he feels they limit creativity and add unnecessary pressure. On the other hand, Ben, her younger son, follows ST. He believes that structuring his day with a fixed schedule ensures efficiency and prevents delays. He plans his work carefully, ensuring that each task is completed within a set deadline. Both approaches have their benefits and challenges. ET allows for creative freedom and reduces stress, but it can lead to procrastination. Some tasks may be left unfinished for too long, causing last-minute rushes. ST, however, promotes discipline and productivity but can become exhausting. Ben often feels drawn into a rigid routine, leaving little room for unexpected changes. At times, his packed schedule makes it difficult to relax. Amy, being a researcher, decided to explore these differences further. She conducted several studies and published papers on time management, analyzing which method works best in different scenarios. She found that neither ET is universally superior. Instead, the effectiveness of each approach depends on personality, work demands, and lifestyle. Some individuals thirst for structure, while others thrive in flexibility. Through her research, Amy suggests that blending both methods might be the ideal approach. A balance between structure and adaptability can help individuals manage their time more effectively. By understanding their own preferences, people can optimize their routines while maintaining creativity and reducing stress. Amy continues to explore these ideas, hoping to offer valuable insights into how people interact with time.\n\nChoose the correct synonym for \"thirst\" as used in the passage.",

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless. And, there is no state backing.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following words is a synonym of \"indicate\" given in the passage?",

But that is not the best way of saving and there are chances of us falling short. A very stringent savings plan that favours future demands over current aspirations is also likely to fail. Instead, a better approach is where due consideration is given to current and future needs. This will help divide the available income between current consumption and future saving. If an expense or a need is too large to be met out of the regular income, earmark it for the future. So the ........................ way to buy a coveted watch is not to swipe the credit card and commit yourself to debt, but to set aside money from your current income and buy the watch when you have the required funds.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following can be best inferred from the paragraph?",

    "question": "Passage: In our fast-paced world, maintaining a clean and organized space can have a profound impact on our mental well-being. Decluttering and cleaning not only enhance the appearance of our surroundings but also help us feel more at peace, reducing stress and anxiety. A clutter-free environment fosters clarity, productivity, and a sense of control over our lives. However, the process of decluttering can sometimes feel daunting, especially when we are stuck in a rut, unsure of where to begin. One of the biggest misconceptions about decluttering is that it must be completed in a single day. In reality, it is far more effective to tackle it gradually. Setting aside just a few minutes each day to remove unnecessary items and organize our belongings can create a lasting habit that prevents clutter from accumulating again. Over time, this small effort results in a cleaner, more refreshing space that boosts our mood and enhances our daily routine. The impacts of decluttering go beyond just having a tidy home. A well-organized space can improve focus, increase efficiency, and even enhance sleep quality. When our surroundings are chaotic, our minds tend to mirror that disorder, making it harder to concentrate or relax. Decluttering eliminates distractions and creates an environment that promotes calmness and positivity. Additionally, a clean space fosters a sense of accomplishment, reinforcing motivation in other areas of life. That being said, decluttering is not always easy. Many of us accumulate sentimental items or struggle with decision-making, making it difficult to part with things we no longer need. At times, we may find ourselves vying between keeping something \"just in case\" and letting it go for the sake of space and simplicity. In such moments, help from a friend, family member, or even a professional organizer can make the process more manageable and enjoyable. Ultimately, decluttering is not just about tidying up-it is a form of self-care. By making it a regular habit, we can create a stress-free environment that allows us to focus on what truly matters in life.\n\nIdentify the incorrect statement based on the passage.",

    "question": "Passage: On the day the rupee breached the 74-mark against the US dollar for the first time, RBI governor Urjit Patel on Friday reiterated that the domestic currency is still better than its emerging market peers and that the apex bank does not have a target for it. After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its fourth bi-monthly policy, this fiscal left the policy rates unchanged and ruled out a rate cut in the rest of the fiscal, the rupee plummeted to 74.13 against the dollar, after opening higher than its previous close at 73.52. Admitting that the country has not been immune to global spillovers from external factors, Patel said, \"The rupee fall, in some respect, is moderate in comparison to several other emerging market peers.\" Ruling out a target for the currency, he said, \"Our response to these unsettled conditions has been to ensure that the foreign exchange market remains liquid with no undue volatility. There is no target or band around any particular level of exchange rate, which is determined by market forces demand and supply.\" Addressing the media after the customary post-policy presser, Mr Patel said the rupee has experienced bouts of volatility since the monetary policy committee meeting in August. By the end of September, the rupee has depreciated in nominal effective terms by 5.6 per cent since the end of March. In real effective term, the rupee fall has been at 5 per cent, the governor said, adding the foreign exchange reserves of $400.5 billion as of end September, are sufficient to finance 10 months of imports.\n\nWhich of the following stands FALSE as per the reading of the given passage?",

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless. And, there is no state backing.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following options conveys the meaning of \"The genie is out of the bottle\"?",

    "question": "Passage: The United States recently lifted its long-standing ban on online betting, paving the way for a significant evolution in the realm of digital entertainment and gambling. This decision has sparked a lively debate among policymakers, economists, and the general public. Proponents argue that online betting, including online poker and various sports wagering platforms, will engage users with a new form of recreational activity while potentially generating substantial revenue through taxation. Critics, however, caution against the social vices that may accompany this shift, such as addiction, financial loss, and deteriorating mental health. With the ban removed, states now have the autonomy to regulate and legislate online their jurisdictions. This is expected to lead to a patchwork of regulations across the country, potentially complicating enforcement and compliance efforts. Moreover, the explosion of online betting activities has raised concerns about the integrity of sports. There is a looming threat that the financial stakes involved in betting might result in increased instances of match-fixing and other unethical practices, compromising the essence of fair sportsmanship. Comparing the situation in the US to Europe, where online betting has long been legal, reveals significant insights. European countries have developed and control online betting activities, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts while capitalizing on the economic benefits. The US, on the other hand, must now navigate these challenges and learn from Europe's experiences to create a balanced approach. The impact of this policy change extends to various sectors of society.

    "question": "Passage: Since 2011, the world's steelmakers have been feeling the heat. Prices for the metal have halved due to flatlining demand and rising exports from China, which now smelts 50% of the global output. Profits at steel firms around the world have fallen into a sea of red ink, shuttering plants and laying off workers. New measures designed to raise the price of carbon in the EU to help the bloc meet its climate-change targets, voted on by the European Parliament on February 15th, threaten to increase the pressure. The industry is a heavy user of carbon; responsible for 5% of global emissions. Some steel firms have responded by calling for carbon tariffs to prevent the measures undermining their international competitiveness. How do border taxes on carbon emissions work? And are they a good idea? The reforms the European Parliament passed this week are an attempt to increase the price of carbon by cutting the emissions allowances granted to firms. The measures include the EU's first border tax on carbon, levied on cement imports. Steel firms, also heavy users of carbon, say their exclusion from this scheme is unfair. This week Lakshmi Mittal, the CEO of Arcelor Mittal, the world's biggest steelmaker, offered his support for the tax. Similar proposals in America are also being mooted. This month a group of Republicans\u2014including two former treasury secretaries, James Baker and George Shultz\u2014proposed a similar levy on imports at the border, as well as for domestic production. Their plan includes a carbon tax on imports of up to $40 for each tonne produced by their manufacture, which would increase over time. The income from the levy would then be distributed to American households on a quarterly basis to make up for higher consumer prices. Proponents of such policies say that they remove the distortions caused by carbon taxes. Under the EU's reforms, steelmakers in Europe would pay up to \u20ac30 ($32) to emit a tonne of carbon, but foreign producers selling in the EU would not have to pay a cent. This harms the cost competitiveness of European producers. It also encourages firms to move production outside the bloc rather than prompt them to use cleaner methods. Taxing imports on their embodied carbon\u2014where this has not already happened in their country of origin\u2014would level the playing field between different systems, they say. It would also give an incentive to countries without controls on emissions to introduce their own carbon taxes, in order to grab a share of the revenues. Economists say the idea works in theory. But many think it would be much more difficult in practice. One big problem is the difficulty of calculating the embodied carbon in imports. This is not easy even for simple sheets of steel; for items made of several bits of metal from different sources, it is hellishly complex. Disputes over this could produce reams of litigation at the WTO between various systems. But the reason why trade economists are so squeamish about carbon tariffs is the fear that they could cause a tariff war. The EU and America are already in a politically driven tit-for-tat over steel duties with China; they have risen in some cases to over 500%. Rather than prod countries to tighten their own regulations, new carbon tariffs could make that battle more vicious. Worse still, lobby groups could easily pervert the charges into a form of quiet protectionism. Donald Trump's presidency has already rattled free-traders' nerves. Why risk giving the protectionists another opening?\n\nQuestion: How can raising carbon prices affect the steel industry?",
    "answer": "The steel industry is a heavy user of carbon and accounts for 5% of the global carbon emissions. Thus raising carbon prices will increase overall cost for the steel industry ultimately lowering their profit margin and cause further increase in already existing problems like closure of plants and laying off of workers."

    "question": "Passage: United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen's proposal for global coordination of corporate taxation has huge implications. She has proposed a global minimum tax rate. If the major world economies agree and the U.S. Congress approves the increased tax rates, it would constitute a reversal of the trend in tax policies since the Soviet Bloc 30 years back. Would Ms. Yellen succeed in convincing OECD countries and the U.S. Congress? David R. Malpass, President of the World Bank, representing the interest of global capital, has voiced his opposition. He was shooting from the shoulders of the poor countries when he said the proposal \"...would hinder poor countries' ability to attract investment\". The initiative which has been long overdue is being forced on the rich countries by the impact of the pandemic. Presently, governments need resources to help people through the transfer of incomes, provision of more public services and also prevent business failures. But their resources have been dismally affected by the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic era, such levels of the deficit would have led to the tanking of the stock markets but now they are booming in anticipation of demand being pumped in by these high deficits. The result is a massive increase in inequality between those who have gained in the stock markets and those who have lost employment and incomes. Additional tax collections can help reduce these large fiscal deficits and that is the reason for the U.S. administration's current proposal. But businesses and conservative legislators will resist. However, some rich Americans like Jeff Bezos have supported the idea of taxing the rich more. Such proposals have been around since 2011 when many of the rich in the U.S. and Europe had supported higher taxation on the rich. Subsequently, this proposal has come up several times. When the Soviet Bloc collapsed in 1990, nations in eastern Europe were badly hit and needed capital infusion to overcome their economic woes. To attract global capital, they cut their tax rates sharply. This resulted in a 'race to the bottom'. Nations in Europe were forced to cut their tax rates one after to not only attract capital but also to prevent capital from leaving their shores. This had global implications. Nations became short of resources and cut back expenditures on public services and encouraged privatization. Governments lacked resources for education, health and civic amenities.\n\nWhat is/are the consequence(s) of increased fiscal deficits?",

    "question": "Passage: Voice or speaker recognition refers to a machine or program's ability to interpret dictation or understand and execute spoken commands. This technology has become increasingly prominent with the ___________ of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Offering hands-free interactions, voice recognition systems enable users to make requests, set reminders, and perform various tasks simply by speaking. The process involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs that can identify and differentiate voices. Some ASR programs necessitate users to train the system for improved accuracy in converting speech to text. Evaluation of a voice's frequency, accent, and speech flow is integral to voice recognition systems. While voice recognition and speech recognition are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings. Voice recognition identifies the speaker, whereas speech recognition assesses the content of what is said. In practice, voice recognition software on computers converts analog audio into digital signals through analog- to-digital (A/D) conversion. This digital database of words or syllables is then compared to signals during pattern recognition. The size of the program's effective vocabulary depends on the computer's RAM capacity, with faster processing speeds enhancing search capabilities. Voice recognition involves analyzing speech through models like the hidden Markov model or recurrent neural networks. The former breaks down spoken words into phonemes, while the latter uses previous outputs to influence current inputs, improving capabilities and accuracy with increased data. The integration of voice recognition into smartphones and home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo has made this technology ubiquitous. As more users engage with voice recognition, the wealth of data generated enhances the capabilities and accuracy of these systems, indicating a promising trajectory for the technology's future. Question: How does Markov model contribute to the overall improvement of voice recognition capabilities?",
    "answer": "Dissection of words into phonetic components allows for a more granular analysis of voice recognition."

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless. And, there is no state backing.\n\nQuestion: How cryptocurrency proliferation is a menace to RBI's existence in economy's financial system?",

This decision has sparked a lively debate among policymakers, economists, and the general public. Proponents argue that online betting, including online poker and various sports wagering platforms, will engage users with a new form of recreational activity while potentially generating substantial revenue through taxation. Critics, however, caution against the social vices that may accompany this shift, such as addiction, financial loss, and deteriorating mental health. With the ban removed, states now have the autonomy to regulate and legislate online their jurisdictions. This is expected to lead to a patchwork of regulations across the country, potentially complicating enforcement and compliance efforts. Moreover, the explosion of online betting activities has raised concerns about the integrity of sports. There is a looming threat that the financial stakes involved in betting might result in increased instances of match-fixing and other unethical practices, compromising the essence of fair sportsmanship. Comparing the situation in the US to Europe, where online betting has long been legal, reveals significant insights. European countries have developed and control online betting activities, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts while capitalizing on the economic benefits.

To attract global capital, they cut their tax rates sharply. This resulted in a 'race to the bottom'. Nations in Europe were forced to cut their tax rates one after to not only attract capital but also to prevent capital from leaving their shores. This had global implications. Nations became short of resources and cut back expenditures on public services and encouraged privatization. Governments lacked resources for education, health and civic amenities.\n\nChoose the most appropriate word from the following options to fill in the blank (1), as highlighted in the given passage.",

    "question": "Passage: In some ways we already do: every time we spend our cash we are making an active choice about the companies we support and the practices we endorse. Today, when corporations can be more influential than entire states, where we put our pounds is where the problem is, so it is difficult to confidently make an informed choice. Consider this: the retail manufacturing industry is the second most polluting industry on earth, second only to oil. According to Annie Leonard, an expert in overconsumption, only 1% of the materials used to produce our consumer goods are still in use six months after sale. Somewhere, the value of craftsmanship and of provenance has been lost. Price and speed are trumping value. However, the tide is turning. Increasing awareness around these issues has led to a rise in what is known as conscious consumption, a movement of people who seek out ways to make positive decisions about what to buy and look for a solution to the negative impact consumerism is having on our world. This is a growing tribe: a third of UK consumers claim to be very concerned about issues regarding the origin of products. A study from YouGov and the Global Poverty Project revealed that 74% of those surveyed would pay an extra 5% for their clothes if there was a guarantee workers were being paid fairly and working in safe conditions. If you're thinking that 5% doesn't sound like a lot, consider the fact that the fashion industry could take a staggering 125 million people out of poverty by adding only 1% of its profits to workers' wages. Issues such as equal pay, environmentally conscious manufacturing processes, prevention of counterfeit goods, human trafficking, responsible farming practices and overproduction of goods are all at the forefront of consumers' minds when making these choices. In an increasingly open, digital world where authenticity is the buzzword of choice, businesses must keep up with growing demands for ethical behaviour and transparency in everything from employee rights and gender discrimination to the supply chain. In studying for my PhD, I researched product supply chain transparency in depth, looking at technologies to improve information about products and the global network of people and resources that fuel them. I believe technology is the key to dealing with the challenges created by consumerism. Open data, social networks and mobile tech can change the game. Groundbreaking technologies could enable transparency in supply chains, which is why this year I have _(1)_on turning my findings into a social enterprise to empower businesses to take steps to being open.\n\nQuestion: Why businesses must keep up with growing demands of ethical behaviour and transparency?",

    "question": "Passage: Over the years, there have been many cases of news breaking about plastic toys and their containment of toxins. In addition to the harmful ingredients that can be found in plastic, we also have to take into account the effect on the environment that plastic usage has. The internet is flooding with ways to reduce plastic usage and people are more aware of the need to cut down on this. Still, it's difficult to change behaviors and somehow parents easily end up with a great number of plastic toys at home. This happens partly because you receive gifts from friends and family, and to some extent because kids prefer bright-colored plastic toys more than bland, wooden ones. Not all toys contain toxins, but they can be found in some cases. Toys that have toxins in them are hazardous to children mainly because of their tendency to swallow and chew on the toys, which can result in the toxins being absorbed by the body. When it comes to young children, even the smallest amounts of toxins can affect their health. The toxins can either be found in the plastic itself or they can be included in the pigments used to color toys and make them more attractive to children. Although there are EU regulations for which toxins may or may not be included in toys, there are products that can slip through the cracks. Plastic toys may, for example, be made of, or contain, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which contains lead and cadmium - both toxins that are harmful to children. The CE mark is supposed to be a sign of quality. The toys have gone through and followed the rigorous EU standards for toys. The EU notes, though, that this marking should only be seen as an indication, as it has been misused due to counterfeiting. As goes for all plastic, plastic toys are made using fossil fuels, and therefore the production of them contributes to the environmental crisis at hand. Therefore, it would be a good idea to minimize the buying of new plastic toys. Environmentalists have raised awareness around the fact that plastic toys are a big part of the plastic that ends up in landfills and oceans, which adds to the ongoing issue of plastic pollution. According to a survey done by the British Heart Foundation, 1 in 3 parents admits to having thrown away toys in working conditions. Considering that 90 percent of toys are in some way made of plastic, that quickly adds up to a lot of plastic waste. In conclusion, yes plastic toys are damaging to the environment. Even though they have a longer life cycle than single-use plastic, they will at some point end up in a landfill - or worse in the sea as non-recyclable waste. But how can we stop this issue? Buy sustainable and non-plastic toys if you do want to buy new toys, try to aim for toys made from more sustainable materials. There are plenty of retailers that focus on environmentally-friendly toys. For example, smaller e-commerce sites like Frida & Fritiof focus on providing non-toxic and eco-labeled toys. If you do want to buy plastic toys, try to minimize the environmental impact by buying them second-hand. There are plenty of charity shops where you can buy toys, but if that is not for you, you can use a site like eBay or any other online marketplace to find second-hand toys. Be aware, though, when buying second-hand toys that security standards might have been updated since they were produced, so double-check that they are up to today's standards.\n\nWhich of the following statement is incorrect?",
    "answer": "It would be a good idea to maximize the buying of new plastic toys."

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless.

If your employer matches part of your contribution - and many do! - you will accumulate yet more. A second way to consistently save is with an automatic savings transfer program with your financial institution. You decide how much and when you want funds transferred from your checking account into a savings account. You can also use a payroll deduction plan from your employer and get the same results.\n\nAlong with how much and how often you save, what you earn on your funds will determine how fast your money grows. You cannot control what happens with interest rates or the stock market, but you can consider different types of savings vehicles that provide different returns. The simplest savings vehicle to consider is buying certificates of deposit (CDs) instead of leaving funds in a savings account. CDs usually offer higher interest rates, but they are time deposits and have ....................... for early withdrawal. If you can accept not having immediate access to your funds, CDs can be an attractive savings vehicle.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following can replace the word given in bold in the passage?",

    "question": "Passage: Cryptocurrency will be discouraged via taxation and capital gains provisions. This was the message from the Finance Minister during the Budget discussion in Parliament. Will this slow the growing use of cryptos in India? Russian kleptocrats have been using cryptos to escape sanctions. Ukraine has been a centre for cryptos trading due to its lax rules and is using them to raise funds for its war with Russia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in February, highlighted two things. First, \"private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability\". Second, \"these cryptocurrencies have no underlying (asset)... not even a tulip\". Soon thereafter, a Deputy Governor of the RBI called cryptos worse than a Ponzi scheme and argued against \"legitimizing\" them. Yet, the RBI announced that it will float a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How do we understand all this? The Supreme Court of India has also asked the Government whether or not cryptos are legal. The Governor calling cryptos as cryptocurrency has unintentionally identified them as a currency. Clearly, statements from the RBI indicate a growing worry since the proliferation of cryptos threatens the RBI's place in the economy's financial system. This threat emerges from the decentralised character of cryptos based on blockchain technology which central banks cannot regulate and which enables enterprising private entities to float cryptos which can function as assets and money. Cryptos which operate via the net can be banned only if all nations come together. Even then, tax havens may allow cryptos to function, defying the global agreement. They have been facilitating the flight of capital and illegality in spite of pressures from powerful nations. The genie is out of the bottle. The total valuation of cryptos recently was upward of $2 trillion - more than the value of gold held globally. A CBDC will not solve the RBI's problem since it can only be a fiat currency and not a crypto. However, cryptos can function as money. This difference needs to be understood. A currency is a token used in market transactions. Historically, commodities (such as copper coins) have been used as tokens since they themselves are valuable. But paper currency is useless till the government declares it to be a fiat currency. It is only then that everyone accepts it at the value printed on it. So, paper currency derives its value from state backing. Cryptos are a string of numbers in a computer programme and are even more worthless.

In other words, it's not actually a tax. It's an \"income-generating scenario for private companies who found a way to make their product look either more directed to or more appropriate for the population and saw that as a moneymaker,\" explains Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a lawyer, vice president for the Brennan School of Justice at NYU School of Law, and co-founder of Period Equity.\n\nYet pink tax is not a new phenomenon. The issue was delineated more finely in 2015 when the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs released a report about price disparities for 794 comparable products from 91 brands sold throughout the city. The report examined five different industries, such as personal care products or senior/home healthcare products. These encompassed 35 product categories, such as bodywash or shampoo. In every single of those five industries, consumer goods marketed to women and girls cost more. The same was the case in all but five of the 35 product categories. Researchers looked at 106 products in the toys and accessories category and found that, on average, those intended for girls were priced 7 percent higher. NYC's report found women faced an average price difference of 13 percent for personal care products among the 122 products compared in the study. And the authors aptly noted that these items, such as shaving gel and deodorant, are the ones purchased most frequently compared with other categories - meaning that the ____________________________________ all those shopping for these products, that 13 percent price increase hits women and girls who come from lower income households even harder. Legislative attempts, however, could correct the pink tax. In 1995, then-Assemblywoman Jackie Speier successfully passed a bill that forbade gender pricing of services, such as haircuts.\n\nWhat is the consequence of gender-based pricing on consumers, particularly women?",

    "question": "Passage: Conversations about the role of flexible working have shifted. It's no longer enough for companies to offer employees the option to either work from home or the office. Employees want to work from anywhere. Companies that want to attract and retain top talent, and ensure teams are highly productive, need to adapt their culture and technology to accommodate this shift in attitudes. And this is where the IT department can solidify its role as a valued contributor to the success of a company, by implementing technologies that enable secure and remote collaboration. According to a recently commissioned Polycom survey, 24,000 respondents across 12 countries indicate that nearly two-thirds of today's global workforce take advantage of the anywhere working model. This is a significant shift since May of 2012 when only 14% of employees benefited from remote working. The survey results also provide insights into some of the concerns among companies in moving forward with the anywhere working model. Two significant concerns are a lack of trust and the perception that employees are not working as hard when they are not in the office. Also, among the 45-60-year-old age group, 59% worry that working anywhere will cause them to work longer hours. The fear of being always connected to work and overworking is a significant deterrent for this age group. A good first step for companies to overcome the trust and perception concern is to ensure workers are measured by output and not by the hours they have worked, commonly referred to as 'presenteeism.' Countries like Brazil | here with 80% of employees adopting the anywhere working model, and 64% respondents use video to communicate several times a day. When respondents were asked how their companies could improve trust and perceptions with the anywhere working model, the most popular recommendations were to: Equip workers with technology that is easy to use and which connects them to their colleagues; Ensure the same policies are applied to everyone in the business, regardless of seniority or their situation; and Provide guidelines on how to manage working from anywhere. 91% of those surveyed agreed that technology is a key factor in improving relationships and fostering better teamwork. This suggests that investing in the right technologies, in particular video collaboration, to get the most out of individuals and teams can help solve the lack of trust and perception concerns. And this is where the IT department can become a difference maker as they can enact technologies, such as video conferencing, to ensure colleagues can seamlessly collaborate wherever they are.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is opposite to COLLABORATION, as highlighted in the given passage?",

    "question": "Passage: Amy Carter, a marketing professor at New York University, has always been fascinated by how people manage time. Her interest deepened when she observed the stark differences between her two sons. Despite growing up in the same environment, they follow completely different approaches to time management. One son follows Eventual Time (ET), while the other relies on Scheduling Time (ST). Daniel, her older son, follows ET, believing that tasks should be completed when the right moment arrives. He enjoys flexibility and trusts that everything will get done eventually. He dislikes strict schedules, as he feels they limit creativity and add unnecessary pressure. On the other hand, Ben, her younger son, follows ST. He believes that structuring his day with a fixed schedule ensures efficiency and prevents delays. He plans his work carefully, ensuring that each task is completed within a set deadline. Both approaches have their benefits and challenges. ET allows for creative freedom and reduces stress, but it can lead to procrastination. Some tasks may be left unfinished for too long, causing last-minute rushes. ST, however, promotes discipline and productivity but can become exhausting. Ben often feels drawn into a rigid routine, leaving little room for unexpected changes. At times, his packed schedule makes it difficult to relax. Amy, being a researcher, decided to explore these differences further. She conducted several studies and published papers on time management, analyzing which method works best in different scenarios. She found that neither ET is universally superior. Instead, the effectiveness of each approach depends on personality, work demands, and lifestyle. Some individuals thirst for structure, while others thrive in flexibility.

Amy continues to explore these ideas, hoping to offer valuable insights into how people interact with time.\n\nChoose the correct synonym for \"drawn\" as used in the passage.",
